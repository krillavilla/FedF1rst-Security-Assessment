# FedF1rst Security Assessment

This project is all about taking charge of implementing the endpoint segment of our organization's security policy tailored for Fed F1rst Control Systems, which is now its own entity. As a security engineer, my plate will be full of diverse tasks. I'll be developing a hardening strategy for Windows Operating Systems, crafting security policies, performing self-assessments, and constructing cloud server build sheets.

## Project Overview

FedF1rst Control Systems has transitioned from being part of a larger organization to becoming an independent company. The objective is to implement robust security measures, particularly focusing on endpoint security. The tasks involve hardening Windows 10 desktops and Windows 2016 servers, creating security policies, performing a self-assessment, and building cloud server build sheets.

## Project Instructions

### Part 1: Develop a Hardening Strategy for Windows Operating Systems

- Analyze the Windows 2016 Server and Windows 10 Desktop for areas of security improvement.
- Identify critical issues and recommend mitigation strategies.
- Fill out the appropriate form with findings and recommendations.

### Part 2: Create Security Policies

- Develop Access Control, Information Security, and IT Asset Management policies tailored to FedF1rst Control Systems.
- Ensure policies cover essential areas such as account creation, password management, data classification, asset management, and network segmentation.

### Part 3: Self-Assessment

- Utilize the provided template to perform a self-assessment on the virtual machines.
- Document identified issues and areas requiring mitigation.

### Part 4: Cloud Server Build Sheet

- Create a vendor-agnostic checklist/build sheet for future cloud servers, focusing on Windows and Linux environments.
- Incorporate insights from the hardening tasks and cloud server lessons to ensure compliance with security policies and standards.

## Project Requirements

- Perform analysis and documentation of security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
- Develop comprehensive security policies tailored to FedF1rst Control Systems.
- Conduct a self-assessment to identify security gaps and areas for improvement.
- Create build sheets for future cloud servers to ensure compliance with security policies and standards.

This project provides hands-on experience in implementing security measures for endpoint devices, creating security policies, and ensuring compliance with industry standards. It is an essential step in enhancing the overall security posture of FedF1rst Control Systems.
