# FedF1rst Security Assessment

This project is about implementing the endpoint segment of our organization's security policy tailored for Fed F1rst Control Systems, which is now its own entity. As a security engineer, my plate will be full of diverse tasks. I'll develop a hardening strategy for Windows Operating Systems, crafting security policies, performing self-assessments, and constructing cloud server build sheets.

## Project Objectives

As part of this project, you'll undertake the following tasks:

### Part 1: Develop a Hardening Strategy for Windows Operating Systems

- Perform a comprehensive Windows 2016 Server and Windows 10 Desktop analysis to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- Recommend mitigation strategies and document critical issues for each system.
- Complete the appropriate documentation to outline findings and remediation steps.

### Part 2: Create Security Policies

- Craft Access Control, Information Security, and IT Asset Management policies tailored to FedF1rst Control Systems' specific requirements.
- Address key areas such as user account management, password policies, data classification, and network segmentation.
- Ensure that policies adhere to industry standards and compliance regulations.

### Part 3: Self-Assessment

- Conduct a thorough self-assessment using the provided template to evaluate the security posture of virtual machines.
- Document identified security gaps, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.
- Prioritize mitigation efforts based on the severity and impact of identified issues.

### Part 4: Cloud Server Build Sheet

- Develop a comprehensive checklist and build sheet for provisioning cloud servers in Windows and Linux environments.
- Incorporate insights gained from the hardening tasks and lessons learned during the cloud server deployment process.
- Ensure the build sheet aligns with FedF1rst Control Systems' security policies and compliance standards.

## Technical Requirements

- Perform in-depth analysis and documentation of security vulnerabilities, including recommended mitigation strategies.
- Develop security policies covering various aspects of access control, information security, and IT asset management.
- Conduct a detailed self-assessment to identify and prioritize security improvements.
- Create vendor-agnostic build sheets for cloud server provisioning, ensuring compliance with security policies and standards.

## Conclusion

This project provided me with hands-on experience in implementing robust security measures for endpoint devices, crafting security policies, and ensuring compliance with industry standards. To progress in Udacity's Enterprise Security Engineer program, I had to ensure each section met specific requirements. It was challenging, but after four submissions, I finally completed the project. The feedback I received after each submission was invaluable, truly ensuring the project's success.
